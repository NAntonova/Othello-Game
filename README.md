# Othello-Game
For one of my programming classes I had an individual project, where I had to implement a single game called Othello on a single computer. Othello (or "Reversi") is a two-player strategy game. The game is played on a rectangular board divided into a grid â€” usually 8x8, though the size of the grid can vary. Players alternately place discs on the game board; one player's discs are black and the other player's are white. When discs are placed on the game board, other discs already on the board are flipped (i.e., a black disc becomes a white disc or vice versa). The game concludes when every square on the grid contains a disc, or when neither player is able to make a legal move; the winning player is generally the one who has either more or less discs on the board at the end of the game, dependeing on what the player chooses.

Here is the description of three files:
  1. othello_logic: implements the game logic.
  2. user_interface_full: implements the console-mode user interface.
  3. othello_gui_full: implements a graphical user interface for Othello using tkinter library. There are still some flaws on how it looks. 

To play Othello, download othello_logic and othello_gui_full and place them into one fold. Then, run othello_gui_full.

Please note that you should type exactly what you will see in the window; otherwise, it will not be working properly. There are still some flaws on how othello_logic works such as if nobody can make a turn, it won't say who won the game. A lot of things can be improved or corrected in graphical user interface as it does not look well.
